# Wemby_vs_Holmgren_NBA_Debut_Sentiment_Comparison

After Victor Wembanyama's first NBA game yesterday, I wanted to know how people's sentiments on Wembanyama's NBA debut compares to Holmgren's. So, here is a simple automated YouTube comment web scraper using Selenium and a basic sentiment analysis through transfer learning using Huggingface's available pretrained multilingual RoBERTa model. 

The findings revealed that a significant portion of the sentiments expressed towards Victor Wembanyama's NBA debut were predominantly negative compared to Chet Holmgren's debut last year. It is important to note that sentiment analysis is subjective and influenced by various factors such as personal biases, online discourse, and specific circumstances surrounding the event. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted within the limitations of the analysis.
